abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyze whether or not there is evidence indicating a significant preference for rail travel over bus, and, if such a preference exists, to learn about the characteristics that affect it and cause it to vary from one situation to another. After a brief review of existing literature, models of choice among alternative travel modes are estimated using revealed preference data and stated preference data. The main conclusion of the study is that there is no evident preference for rail travel over bus when quantifiable service characteristics such as travel time and cost are equal, but a bias does arise when rail travel offers a higher quality service. The investigation of the impact of different service characteristics using more advanced demand estimation techniques is suggested as a topic for future research.},

abstract = {Graphs have been widely used to model relationships among data. For large graphs, excessive edge crossings make the display visually cluttered and thus difficult to explore. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based edge-clustering framework that can group edges into bundles to reduce the overall edge crossings. Our method uses a control mesh to guide the edge-clustering process; edge bundles can be formed by forcing all edges to pass through some control points on the mesh. The control mesh can be generated at different levels of detail either manually or automatically based on underlying graph patterns. Users can further interact with the edge-clustering results through several advanced visualization techniques such as color and opacity enhancement. Compared with other edge-clustering methods, our approach is intuitive, flexible, and efficient. The experiments on some large graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

@article{5290710,
abstract = {Spatial interactions (or flows), such as population migration and disease spread, naturally form a weighted location-to-location network (graph). Such geographically embedded networks (graphs) are usually very large. For example, the county-to-county migration data in the U.S. has thousands of counties and about a million migration paths. Moreover, many variables are associated with each flow, such as the number of migrants for different age groups, income levels, and occupations. It is a challenging task to visualize such data and discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their geographic patterns simultaneously. This paper addresses these challenges by developing an integrated interactive visualization framework that consists three coupled components: (1) a spatially constrained graph partitioning method that can construct a hierarchy of geographical regions (communities), where there are more flows or connections within regions than across regions; (2) a multivariate clustering and visualization method to detect and present multivariate patterns in the aggregated region-to-region flows; and (3) a highly interactive flow mapping component to map both flow and multivariate patterns in the geographic space, at different hierarchical levels. The proposed approach can process relatively large data sets and effectively discover and visualize major flow structures and multivariate relations at the same time. User interactions are supported to facilitate the understanding of both an overview and detailed patterns.},

The present study highlights innovative uses of data collected via automatic vehicle location and automatic passenger count technologies in the areas of scheduling and operations management at TriMet, the transit provider for the Portland, Oregon metropolitan region. Two main topics are addressed in this paper. First, we look at efforts at TriMet involving the use of archived operations data to improve bus schedules. Second, we look at the role of operator behavior in relation to service reliability and steps the agency is taking to reduce run time variability and maintain vehicle headways through better management of operators. The quality, quantity, and disaggregate nature of data at TriMet has greatly enhanced the agency’s ability to generate performance reports as well as undertake special purpose studies targeting specific operational issues, providing essential feedback into the scheduling process.},

The goal of this project was to develop a database model and a data mining and fusing algorithm that would combine these two separate data sets for systematic analysis. The resulting database model, by generating performance measures, allowed a transit manager or operator to identify problematic locations in the network and to implement appropriate strategies to maintain overall system performance, and could also be used to improve data quality through data mining and fusion from other data sources.},

Because of the large scale of the data size, a two-step combination of K-Transfer and Multi-Objective algorithms is used to optimize the system response time.

abstract = {Bus is public means to travel in several cities. Traditional maps provide with the information of bus routes that passengers may use to design a travel from a place to another. It is difficult for them to obtain an appropriate route because of the lack of the information of time on the traditional maps. Some web sites enable passengers to take bus but they do not support passengers to have more diverse selections. In this paper, buses are considered as moving objects. Mathematically, movements of objects are the mappings (functions) from times to locations. In 3-D Cartesian coordinate systems, space-time cubes, which are called temporal maps in this paper, are models representing movements in spatio-temporal domain. A bus route on a traditional map is the curve connecting the spatial positions where the bus visits, from the departure station to the arrival. A bus trip is a bus route included time. It is represented on temporal maps. With the visualization of spatio-temporal data of bus trips on temporal maps, passengers may mark out bus trips for their more appropriate travels. This article implemented visualization tools for the design of bus travels on temporal maps.},

Density maps as proposed by Scheepens et al. [25] are a way to reveal these patterns by means of aggregations of filtered subsets of trajectories. Since filtering is often not sufficient for analysts to express their domain knowledge, we propose to use expressions instead. We present a flexible architecture for density maps to enable custom, versatile exploration using multiple density fields. The flexibility comes from a script, depicted in this paper as a block diagram, which defines an advanced computation of a density field. We define six different types of blocks to create, compose, and enhance trajectories or density fields. Blocks are customized by means of expressions that allow the analyst to model domain knowledge. The versatility of our architecture is demonstrated with several maritime use cases developed with domain experts. Our approach is expected to be useful for the analysis of objects in other domains.},

abstract = {Visualizing trajectory attribute data is challenging because it involves showing the trajectories in their spatio-temporal context as well as the attribute values associated with the individual points of trajectories. Previous work on trajectory visualization addresses selected aspects of this problem, but not all of them. We present a novel approach to visualizing trajectory attribute data. Our solution covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked 3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color. Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime navigation. User feedback obtained in a small experiment indicates that our hybrid 2D/3D solution can be operated quite well.},

abstract = {We introduce a focus+context method to visualize a complicated metro map of a modern city on a small displaying area. The context of our work is with regard the popularity of mobile devices. The best route to the destination, which can be obtained from the arrival time of trains, is highlighted. The stations on the route enjoy larger spaces, whereas the other stations are rendered smaller and closer to fit the whole map into a screen. To simplify the navigation and route planning for visitors, we formulate various map characteristics such as octilinear transportation lines and regular station distances into energy terms. We then solve for the optimal layout in a least squares sense. In addition, we label the names of stations that are on the route of a passenger according to human preferences, occlusions, and consistencies of label positions using the graph cuts method. Our system achieves real-time performance by being able to report instant information because of the carefully designed energy terms. We apply our method to layout a number of metro maps and show the results and timing statistics to demonstrate the feasibility of our technique.},
