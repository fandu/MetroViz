%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1
%% typefaces, ``graphicx'' for inclusion of EPS figures. and ``times''
%% for proper handling of the times font family.

\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{times}

%% We encourage the use of mathptmx for consistent usage of times font
%% throughout the proceedings. However, if you encounter conflicts
%% with other math-related packages, you may want to disable it.

Conclusions
  Public transportation is an important part our daily life. In the operation of public transportation, ridership and adherence data have been collected. With the growth of data scale, the department of transportation is in need of powerful visualization tools to explore the data, and gain insights. In this paper, we developed a visual tool to help explore the data, and gain insights. Our tool provides a map view and a route view to help people quickly locate stops and routes. A calendar view to provide a overview of adherence / ridership information for several years. A trip and a stop view to help people get details of trips and stops on specific days. Two CATT Lab researchers and twelve computer science PhD students took part in a study in which they used our tool to explore bus ridership and adherence data of Blacksburg City. THe participants were able to use our tool to locate stops and routes, and detect abnormal stops and routes, and find abnormal days.
